Task: 

Request-I. Find the 10th character and display it on the screen.

Request-II. Find every 10th character (i.e. 10th, 20th, 30th, etc.) and display the array on the screen.

Request-III. Split the text into words using whitespace characters (i.e. space, tab, line break, etc.) count the occurrence of every unique word (case insensitive) and display the count for each word on the screen.


Approach:

This app is developed with compose and with a very basic and simple UI but all with love.
I used MVVM clean architecture modularization pattern following the solid principles,
This project has multiple layers like Domain, data etc This app uses Hilt for 
dependency injection, skrape library for parsing content from blog.
